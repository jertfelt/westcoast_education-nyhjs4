Student work for Nackademin, a course in test-driven development in React.
In this course, I have used at first localhost but then firebase.
I have used unit testing and some interaction tests in this development.
In the cases where I have installed firebase I have done so by first making the code test-driven and then exchanging code where it was needed.
