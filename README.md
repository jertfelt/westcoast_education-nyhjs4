Student work for Nackademin, a course in test-driven development in React.
In this course, I have used at first localhost as a db, with a useFetch hook to axios, but then I switched to firebase for some parts.
I have used mainly unit testing and some interaction tests in this development.

In the cases where I have installed firebase I have done so by first making the code test-driven and then exchanging code where it was needed. The testing codes from these components have sadly been taken away for the time being as I couldn't figure out how to test firebase.
